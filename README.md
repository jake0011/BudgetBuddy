# BudgetBuddy Requirement Analysis

This document outlines the deliverables produced during the requirement analysis phase of the BudgetBuddy project. Requirement analysis is the first and a critical step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that ensures the final product aligns with the stakeholders' needs.

## Project Deliverables:

# 1. Requirement Specification Document (RSD)
